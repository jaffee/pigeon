* Overview

Pigeon is a simple webapp which listens for [[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/web_hooks/web_hooks.md][gitlab webhooks]], and then
POSTs to JIRA's API with comments on any issues referenced in the
pushed commits.

* Configuration
Copy pigeon/config.template.py to pigeon/config.py and fill it in with
values appropriate to your setup. You'll probably want to create a
JIRA user specifically for use with this application - I called mine
gitlab.

You need to register the URL at which you intend to run this service
with gitlab. The path to use is "/push". Settings > Web Hooks (within
whatever project you want to enable the functionality for)
